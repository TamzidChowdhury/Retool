This project is a custom internal refund management tool built with Retool, designed for a fictional eCommerce bookstore called Galapagos.com. It enables support teams to search customers, view order history, inspect purchased items, and process refundsâ€”all in a user-friendly, secure interface with role-based access and audit tracking.
